# Cpu-Logism
For this project, you will be building a small single-cycle CPU. Your CPU will be capable of running real programs (with conditionals, function calls, etc), outputting numbers, and even printing things to a screen and accepting keyboard input. You know, like a real computer!

# Project overview
The cpu2214 architecture is a 16-bit architecture with some similarities to MIPS. It is a single-cycle Harvard architecture machine.
